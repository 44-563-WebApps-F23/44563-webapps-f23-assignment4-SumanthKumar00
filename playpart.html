        <p>
            A prettily furnished small drawing-room in SOLNESS'S house.
            In the back, a glass-door leading out to the verandah and
            garden.  The right-hand corner is cut off transversely by
            a large bay-window, in which are flower-stands.  The left-
            hand corner is similarly cut off by a transverse wall, in
            which is a small door papered like the wall.  On each side,
            an ordinary door.  In front, on the right, a console table
            with a large mirror over it.  Well-filled stands of plants
            and flowers.  In front, on the left, a sofa with a table
            and chairs.  Further back, a bookcase.  Well forward in the
            room, before the bay window, a small table and some chairs.
            It is early in the day.<br>
            <br>
            SOLNESS sits by the little table with RAGNAR BROVIK'S
            portfolio open in front of him.  He is turning the drawings
            over and closely examining some of them.  MRS. SOLNESS moves
            about noiselessly with a small watering-pot, attending to her
            flowers.  She is dressed in black as before.  Her hat, cloak
            and parasol lie on a chair near the mirror.  Unobserved by her,
            SOLNESS now and again follows her with his eyes.  Neither of
            them speaks.<br>
            <br>
            KAIA FOSLI enters quietly by the door on the left.<br>
            <br>
            SOLNESS.<br>
            [Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:] Well, is
            that you?<br>
            <br>
            KAIA.
            <br>
            I merely wished to let you know that I have come.
            <br>
            <br>
            SOLNESS.
            <br>
            Yes, yes, that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too?
            <br>
            <br>
            KAIA.
            <br>
            No, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is
            coming presently to hear--
            <br>
            <br>
            SOLNESS.
            <br>
            How is the old man to-day?
            <br>
            <br>
            KAIA.
            <br>
            Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
            to-day.
            <br>
            <br>
            SOLNESS.
            <br>
            Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.
            <br>
            <br>
            KAIA.
            <br>
            Yes. [Pauses at the door.] Do you wish to speak to Ragnar when he comes?
            <br>
            <br>
            SOLNESS.
            <br>
            No--I don't know that I have anything particular to say to him.
            <br>
                 [KAIA goes out again to the left.  SOLNESS remains seated,
                   turning over the drawings.]
                   <br>
                   <br>
            MRS. SOLNESS.
            <br>
            [Over beside the plants.] I wonder if he isn't going to die now, as
            well?
            <br>
